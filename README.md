# Techdegree Project 2 - Mobile-First Responsive Layout

 **Skills Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- Mobile-First Responsive Design

**Project Description:**

For this project I created all of the HTML & CSS from scratch. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. For this design I used a mobile-first approach where I designed the mobile view of this project as the basis for the base CSS. I then added media query breakpoints at 768px and 1024px and styled those breakpoints respectively. I linked the navigation menu to the correct sections of the page. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by adding a skills section with my own custom textual content, I changed the background color of the main content section and added additional styling for links (ie, borders, hover states). I also used semantic HTML markup for all of the respective elements.

This project was designed according to the provided mockups.

**Exceeds Expectations Requirements:**

Add an additional section to the page, such as a skills section. Donâ€™t forget to create a working link to your new section in the navigation menu.

Add at least TWO additional items to to further style and enhance the portfolio:

- A new background color for the navigation and/or main sections of the site.
- Change the color of at least one piece of text.
- Add one additional google font that is being used on the page.
- Any additional styling for links (ie, borders, hover states).

When creating your navigation bar, use the HTML5 `<nav>` element for extra structure and semantic markup.

**Grade Received:**

Exceeds Expectations
